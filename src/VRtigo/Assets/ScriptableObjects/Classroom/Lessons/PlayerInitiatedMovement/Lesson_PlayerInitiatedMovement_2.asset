  - m_DialogueString: However, <b>vection</b> does not necessarily always cause motion
      sickness.
  - m_DialogueString: "Almost no motion sickness is experienced when the scene moves
      in\r constant/linear velocity. The mismatch between what is seen (visual cues)\r\nand
      what is physically felt (vestibular cues) is okay!"
