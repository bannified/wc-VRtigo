  LessonSteps:
  - m_DialogueString: <b>Vection</b> is when you feel that your body is moving when
      no physical movement is taking place.
  - m_DialogueString: <b>Movement in Virtual Reality</b> experiences evokes vection.
  - m_DialogueString: However, <b>vection</b> does not necessarily always cause motion
      sickness.
  - m_DialogueString: "Almost no motion sickness is experienced when the scene moves
      in\r constant/linear velocity. The mismatch between what is seen (visual cues)\r\nand
      what is physically felt (vestibular cues) is okay!"
  - m_DialogueString: 'The mismatch between what is seen (visual cues)

      and
      what is physically felt (vestibular cues) is okay!'
  - m_DialogueString: "However, when the scene movement accelerates or there is a
      angular \rmotion VR sickness happens."
